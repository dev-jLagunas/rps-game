# Rock Paper Scissors Advanced Frontend Mentor Challenge

## Description

This project is an advanced challenge from Frontend Mentor, implemented using Angular v17, SCSS, and HTML. The challenge was an excellent opportunity to delve deeper into Angular's control flow, RxJS Observables, and the use of a shared service for communication between components. The Angular Router was also utilized to manage navigation between different components.

A significant focus was placed on adhering to best practices for HTML and SCSS. This ensured the creation of clean, maintainable, and scalable code. The project serves as a testament to the power of Angular and its capabilities in building complex, interactive web applications. I can imagine how much more complex this project would have been without a framework like Angular.
